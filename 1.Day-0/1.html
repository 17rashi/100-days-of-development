   <h3> Introduction to web-development and HTML's Basics</h3>
   <h1>HOW DOES INTERNET WORKS?</h1>
   <p>The internet is a worldwide computer network that transmits a variety of data and media across interconnected devices. It works by using a packet routing network that follows Internet Protocol (IP) and Transport Control Protocol (TCP)</p>
   <p>TCP and IP work together to ensure that data transmission across the internet is consistent and reliable, no matter which device you’re using or where you’re using it.</p>
   <h2>Internet Protocol (IP)</h2>
   <p>Rules that govern how information is sent from one computer to another computer over an internet connection
      Specifies how computers should send information to other computers by sending data with an attached numerical address (IP Address)
      <li>IP Address: Accessible over the internet</li> 
      <li>Private IP Address: Assigned to a device on a closed network such as a home or business network that’s not accessible over the internet</li>
